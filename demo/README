Two FASTA files (groups) are provided (see 'most_induced.fasta' and 
'most_suppressed.fasta') to demonstrate usage of this tool.
Both groups represent promoter-sequences 2kb upstream of 
differentially-expressed genes from a Soybean--Soybean Rust RNA-Seq
study (Tremblay et. al., 2012).

Accompanying PWMs
=================
Accompanying these FASTA files are several PWMs. Since
PWM distribution restrictions exist, we generated de-novo PWM models 
(see 'sample_pwms.txt') using several known plant-PDB structures and the 
web-application '3DTF' (Alamanova et. al., 2012).

Accompanying DNA motifs
=======================
A set of manually-mined DNA TFBS motifs are available (see 'sample_motifs.txt').
These motifs came from the following peer-reviewed publications:

1) "Selective interaction of plant homeodomain proteins mediates high 
DNA-binding affinity.", Smith et. al., 2002.
2) "Determinants in the sequence specific binding of two plant transcription 
factors, CBF1 and NtERF2, to the DRE and GCC motifs.", Hao et. al., 2002.
3) "Isolation and characterization of three DREB/ERF-type transcription 
factors from melon (Cucumis melo).", Mizuno et. al., 2006.
4) "Soybean Trihelix Transcription Factors GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B Improve Plant 
Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses in Transgenic Arabidopsis.", Xie et. al., 2009.
5) "Molecular cloning and characterization of a gene that encodes a 
MYC-related protein in Arabidopsis.", Urao et. al., 1996.
6) "Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH 
transcription factor in graminaceous plants.", Ogo et. al., 2006.
7) "Stimulus-Dependent, Promoter-Specific Binding of Transcription Factor 
WRKY1 to Its Native Promoter and the Defense-Related Gene PcPR1-1 in Parsley",
Turck et. al., 2004.
8) "ARF1, a transcription factor that binds to auxin response elements.",
Ulmasov et. al., 1996.
9) "Auxin signal transduction in Arabidopsis vein formation.", 
Donner et. al., 2010.
